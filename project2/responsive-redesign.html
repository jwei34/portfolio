            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>My goal for this project was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. It involved
                analyzing and identifying flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity
                prototypes
                for various screen sizes, and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.</p>
            <p>The website I picked to redesign is the <a href="https://exploreri.org/gtraillist.php"
                    style="color: #E77433;">Rhode Island Trail Finder</a>. I found it by Googling “Rhode Island Trails,”
                and
                thought it would be a great website to redesign because a more attractive interface could encourage more
                people to explore Rhode Island’s various nature offerings.</p>
                <h4>Screenshot of Original Website:</h4>
              <img class="image" src="media/explore-ri.png" style="width: 80%" alt="site-screenshot">
            <h4>Building a Conceptual Model</h4>
            <p>A <b>conceptual model </b>is about how an interface reveals to the user how it works. Websites generally
                rely
                on visual cues to communicate their designer-envisioned models to users.</p>
            <p>At the top of the interface's <b>hierarchy</b> is the large heading “Rhode Island Trail Finder: Go for a
                Walk!” effectively communicates that this is a tool for finding trails in Rhode Island (RI). Below this,
                there is a blue box with interactive input fields, buttons, and dropdown menus for finding and filtering
                trails. At the bottom, there is a table, presumably with a list of trails that fit the criteria defined
                in
                the section above. </p>
            <p>My <b>initial impressions</b> were that the interface’s general flow makes sense, and that the visual
                formats
                of its input boxes, buttons, and sorting and filtering tools mostly follow conventions that efficiently
                indicate their functions. However, the placement of many elements feels cluttered and random, without a
                clear hierarchy, and there is a lot of inconsistency between the different types of search tools.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
            <p><b>Usability</b> is the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to <i>easily</i>
                perform
                the tasks while enjoying the experience. It encompasses dimensions such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Learnability</b>: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they
                    encounter
                    the design?</li>
                <li><b>Efficiency</b>: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?</li>
                <li><b>Memorability</b>: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can
                    they
                    reestablish proficiency?</li>
                <li><b>Errors</b>: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they
                    recover from the errors?</li>
                <li><b>Satisfaction</b>: How pleasant is it to use the design?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In general, interfaces should be simply, easy to learn, provide appropriate and feedback, and have
                controls
                that people expect. Upon closer look at the RI Trail Finder interface, I found a number of usability
                issues
                that make it more difficult to navigate than necessary.</p>

                    <b>Usability Issue #1: Confusing Site Title &amp; Navigation.</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The cursor changes for all headers upon hover, but some aren't actually clickable. This is poor
                                feedback as the cursor switch is usually associated with clickable buttons.</li>
                            <li>The page title ("Rhode Island Trail
                                Finder: Go for a Walk!") is inconsistent with the menu option (”Trail List/Trail Map”) and the
                                browser tab title (”Explore Rhode Island…”).</li>
                            </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Usability Issue #2: Unstandardized Buttons. </b>
                        There are several types of buttons, which makes it hard to learn what function each has.
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Go" & "Reset" are very default buttons and work as expected. </li>
                            <li>Pictorial type of trail buttons: At first look, these didn’t even look like buttons. I only realized
                                that they can be used to filter trails after I read the description. Good design shouldn’t require
                                this.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Usability Issue #3: Inconsistent Dropdown Menu Functions.</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sort List By & Difficulty are both dropdowns, but one sorts and the other filters. I think these
                                shouldn’t look the same bc their functions are a bit diffrent. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Usability Issue #4: Poor Feedback of "Difficulty" Dropdown Menu.</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mechanism of the "Difficulty" dropdown is confusing. Although the ‘Very Easy’ and ‘Easy’ options
                                seem to working correctly, filtering for only trails that have these words in them, the ‘Moderate’
                                and ‘Difficult’ options look the same, with both include the full list of trails from ‘very easy’ to
                                ‘difficult’. → can’t recognize </li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Usability Issue #5: Disorganized & misleading use of icons. </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Serve as buttons at top but just simple icons in the table</li>
                            <li>Disorganized placement in table</li>
                            <li>Sizes aren’t uniform</li>
                        </ul>

            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
                After identifying usability issues myself, I used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/"
                    style="color: #E77433;">WebAIM WAVE</a> to detect possible accessibility problems. Here are 3 more
                significant problems it identified:
            </p>
            <img class="image" src="media/WAVE.png" alt="wave-issues-markup">
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Navigation bar's contrast is too low: AGREE.</b> I think the light yellow text on the
                    semi-transparent dark blue background is quite legible, but the contrast is largely because of the
                    dark banner photo behind it. Without this photo, the dark blue background would be too transparent.
                </li>
                <li><b>Small text: AGREE. </b>It was easy for me to see this, but I can definitely see it being too
                    small for far-sighted people, e.g. my parents.</li>
                <li><b> No page regions: DISAGREE.</b> WAVE says that the RI Trail Finder has significant page regions
                    that are not defined with appropriate HTML regions such as header, nav, main, footer, as well as
                    other regions such as banner, navigation, main. However, using the Inspect tool reveals that there
                    are, in fact, distinct regions defined in HTML.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="content-grid" id="part2">
            <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
            <p>Based on the problems you identified in Part 1 and the page that you chose, create low-fidelity
                wireframes, a visual design style guide, and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
            <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
                Overall Redesign Highlights:
            <ul>
                <li>Separated “Find Trails” and “What do you want to find?” sections</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed page's menu dropdown name to be more consistent with header on the actual page</li>
                    <li>Changed navigation bar menu item to better match page title.</li>
                    <li>Put “What do you want to find?” filters below “Find Trails” as dropdowns with a checkbox system,
                        aligned left</li>
                    <li>Put "Sort List By" aligned to the right; the separation indicate it works differently than the
                        filter dropdowns.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Added a map element for more visual & geographic trail search</li>
                <li>Redesigned trail table to be more like contact cards rather a long list of words</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                Because this part of the assignment is focused on responsive design rather than development, I used dummy elements for
                navigational elements, buttons, dropdown menus, and other dynamic elements.</p>
