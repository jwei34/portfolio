</button>

    <ul>
        <li>The cursor changes for all headers upon hover, but some aren't actually clickable. This is
            poor
            feedback as the cursor switch is usually associated with clickable buttons.</li>
        <li>The page title ("Rhode Island Trail
            Finder: Go for a Walk!") is inconsistent with the menu option (”Trail List/Trail Map”) and
            the
            browser tab title (”Explore Rhode Island…”).</li>

    <b>2.</b> Unstandardized Buttons
</button>
<div class="expanded-content">
    <p style="padding-left:18px;">
        There are several types of buttons, which makes it hard to learn what function each has.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Go" & "Reset" are very default buttons and work as expected. </li>
        <li>Pictorial type of trail buttons: At first look, these didn’t even look like buttons. I only
            realized
            that they can be used to filter trails after I read the description. Good design shouldn’t
            require
            this.</li>

    <b>3.</b> Inconsistent Dropdown Menu Functions
</button>
<div class="expanded-content">
    <ul>
        <li>Sort List By & Difficulty are both dropdowns, but one sorts and the other filters. I think
            these
            shouldn’t look the same bc their functions are a bit diffrent. </li>

    <b>4.</b> Poor Feedback of "Difficulty" Dropdown Menu
</button>
<div class="expanded-content">
    <ul>
        <li>The mechanism of the dropdown is confusing. Although the ‘Very Easy’ and ‘Easy’
            options
            seem to working correctly, filtering for only trails that have these words in them, the
            ‘Moderate’
            and ‘Difficult’ options look the same, with both include the full list of trails from ‘very
            easy’ to
            ‘difficult’. → can’t recognize </li>
