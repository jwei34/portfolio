                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: .5em;">For this classic UI/UX project, I conducted user experience (UX)
                    research by observing real users interacting with an interface in public view.
                <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0%; padding-top: 0%;"> The interface I chose is Snackpass'
                    self-ordering kiosk at boba shops. </h3>
                My project involved:
                <ul>
                    <li>Interviewing individuals about their experiences with the interface,</li>
                    <li>Creating personas based on these users, and</li>
                    <li>Illustrating a storyboard for one of my personas.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why The Boba Self-Ordering Kiosk Interface?</h4>
                <p>
                    The area around Thayer Street of Brown University currently houses four boba shops: Vivi Bubble Tea,
                    Kung Fu Tea, Ten One Tea House, and Tiger Sugar. I noticed that the two newest stores — Ten One and
                    Tiger Sugar — have both opted to
                    <span class="bold"> take orders through Snackpass' self-ordering kiosk instead of through
                        employees.</span>
                    I decided to choose one of these boba self-ordering kiosks for this assignment
                    because I was curious about what boba customers think about the interface
                    (and wanted an excuse to have some boba catch-up sessions with friends).
                </p>
                <h4>Features of the Interface</h4>
                <p> Before diving into my findings, I'd like to provide two Figma mockups of the self-ordering kiosk at
                    Ten One. Below, I highlight some important features of the interface as users browse and add items.

                <h2>Building Personas</h2>
                <h4>Observations</h4>
                <p>
                    While observing my interviewees, I found that they:
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigated the interface easily and noted that it was much like using the Snackpass phone app.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tended to scroll through all the options presented first, and tap through the different category
                        buttons after.</li>
                    <li>Explored all items, but generally went with a familiar drink, citing the expensive price of boba
                        as a contributor to choosing 'safer' options.</li>
                    <li>Did not use the search bar at all.</li>
                </ul>
                In addition, less frequent boba goers tapped through more options before selecting their final order.
                More frequent goers generally recognized the drinks from product cards alone, so the one they tapped to
                expand was usually they one they ordered.
                </p>
                <h4>Interviews</h4>
                <p>
                    To better understand the users of this interface, I prepared some questions that I believed would
                    solicit insight about my interviewees’ expectations, experience, motives, and challenges when using
                    the interface.

                        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Typical boba drinkers range from infrequent (once every 1-2 months) to frequent (2-3
                                times/week). </li>
                            <li>Getting boba is an overwhelmingly social & leisurely activity (in contrast to getting
                                coffee before work, for example). </li>
                            <li>Customers usually have an idea of what they want, but the self-ordering kiosk
                                facilitates exploration → customers are more likely to try something new. </li>
                            <li>Visual, descriptive, and price information help users explore and make informed
                                decisions.</li>
                            <li>Scrolling through too many options can lead to choice overload. Seeing popular items
                                highlighted is helpful.</li>

            <h4>A Walkthrough of Jamie's Boba Ordering Experience</h4>
            <img class="image" src="media/storyboard.png" alt="storymap">
            <p>
                From Jamie’s journey, we see ordering and drinking boba is most often the backdrop of a socially-driven
                activity. This means that it is important for the boba self-ordering interface to be quick & seamless to
                navigate because it is just a vehicle for the more important objective of spending time with friends.

            <h2>Project Takaways</h2>
            <p>
                I found this project great for developing my UX research skills. By mapping the user journeys of a
                public interface from beginning to end, I was able to build a comprehensive picture of various users'
                motivations, goals, and emotions. It is important to recognize the value in conducting thorough user
                reserach when creating and iterating though interfaces because my own goal as a UX Designer is to create
                experiences that are as easy and fun for end users as possible.
