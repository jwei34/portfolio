				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</h4>
				<p>
					The goal of this project was to design an interactive interface around the concept of an emerging
					startup, working in a team of four to create multiple iterations of low- and high-fidelity mockups.
				</p>
				<h4>Startup Context</h4>
				<p>
					Kopa is the marketplace for <b>monthly rentals and compatible housemates</b>, and the company’s
					mission is to
					enable people to browse rentals, find roommates, and book and pay for spaces in a one-stop-shop.
					Currently the
					start-up is still in operation, and that’s why we believe a redesign might bring some real-world
					impact to
					this company.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our favourite quote from the company founder and CEO is: “We believe that exploration and community
					make
					people whole. Kopa exists to inspire people to get out of their comfort zones, to form lasting
					relationships,
					and to live more fulfilled lives.”
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Low-fidelity Sketches</h2>
				<p>
					To start our design process, we had a brainstorm session - each one of the group member
					independently drew
					their idea for the pages on a blank canvas. Here is what we got:
				</p>
				<img class="sketches" src="./signup.png" />
				<img class="sketches" src="./browserental.png" />
				<img class="sketches" src="./findroommate.png" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content-grid" id="lowfifinal">
			<h2>Finalized Low-fi Wireframe</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
				After the initial individual sketching, we put our sketches together and brainstormed the best layout.
				We made
				our low-fi sketches into wireframes to guide our high-fidelity design process.
			</p>

				<h2>Interactive Hi-Fi Mock Up: Iteration 1</h4>
					<p>
						Below is the first iteration of our high-fidelity Figma mockup. We created the 3 main screens of
						Kopa: (renter) signup, browsing rentals, and finding roommates.
					</p>
					<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450"

					<h2>Critique Session (ft. Industry expert!)</h2>
					<p>
						During our critique session, we presented the first iteration of our hi-fi mockups (see above).
						We had the opportunity to receive feedback on from not only fellow peers but also an
						industry expert, Gifford Cheung, who is a Sr. UX Researcher @Nintendo (and ex-classmate of
						Jeff!). Below, we highlighted some of the feedback we received from peers and Gifford.
					</p>
					<center>
						<h4>General Feedback</h4>
					</center>
					<p>
						Reviewers generally liked our UI (e.g. color palette) and design hierarchy for the 3 pages
						(sign-up, browse
						rentals, find roommates). Particularly, they thought the layouts of the sign-up and find
						roommates pages were
						fun and innovative.
					</p>
					<center>
						<h4>Find Roommates Page Feedback</h4>
					</center>
					<div class="column-list">
						<div class="column">
							<p class="suggestion">
								<b>Suggestion #1</b>: The page is a bit overwhelming without any guidance; clarification
								about its
								structure/algorithm would be helpful.
							</p>
							<p class="changed">
								<b>What we changed</b>: Added welcome text briefly explaining our matching algorithm and
								categories. This
								also added some white space for improved hierarchy.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<p class="suggestion">
								<b>Suggestion #2</b>: At first, it is unclear that users can scroll horizontally in
								addition to the
								traditional vertical scroll.
							</p>
							<p class="changed">
								<b>What we changed</b>: Added arrows on the right end of each category to indicate the
								ability to scroll
								horizontally.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<center>
						<h4>Browse Rentals Page Feedback</h4>
					</center>
					<div class="column-list">
						<div class="column">
							<p class="suggestion">
								<b>Suggestion #1</b>: Reviewers thought our ‘Bookmarked’ box at the bottom right was an
								important
								component but wasn’t prominent enough.
							</p>
							<p class="changed">
								<b>What we changed</b>: Made the ‘Bookmarked’ box larger, expandible/collapsible, and
								added a dark header
								section that pops out from the map more. We also added a shortcut to bookmarked items in
								the header, so it
								is accessible at all times.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<p class="suggestion">
								<b>Suggestion #2</b>: Reviewers thought it'd be helpful to provide information about
								what kinds of information
								they can enter into the search bar.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What we changed</b>: Added placeholder text to indicate possible entries for the area
								search.

				<h2>Annotated Changes After Critique</h2>
				<p>
					After hearing the thoughts of Gifford and our peers during the critique session, we made changes to
					our
					high-fidelity mock up to incorporate the great suggestions reviewers made. Below are annotated
					versions of our high-fidelity mock
					ups.

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<p>We gave users the following scenario, which we thought would encapsulate Kopa’s typical persona and user
				motivation:
			<ul>
				<li> Imagine you are a college student who has an internship in NYC this upcoming summer. </li>
				<li> You want to compare short-term rentals within your price range. </li>
				<li> You also want to find quiet, outdoorsy roommates you can share your lease with. </li>
			</ul>
			We also made sure to let users know that this is not an actual website but an interactive mockup made on
			prototyping software, so not all button functions are built out.
			</p>
			<!-- <h4>Final Prototype</h4> -->
			<!-- <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FIj4khB3jnSR3dyKooob8Ew%2FIterative-Design-Hi-Fi%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D253%253A2447%26starting-point-node-id%3D253%253A2363%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width%26show-proto-sidebar%3D1" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
			<h4>Video Walkthrough</h4>
			<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ImU7TDA-W74"
				title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
				allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
				allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h4>Tasks & Results</h4>
			<p>
				We gave users 3 tasks, which we thought would encapsulate the 3 key functionalities and screens of our
				website. Each task was assessed according to the following 2 metrics, “Success” (Yes or No) and
				“Difficulty”
				(Very difficult to Very easy, with a 5-point rating scale)
			</p>
			<div class="scroll-container" style="height:300px">
				<b>Task 1: Sign up as a renter.</b> (Sign Up Page)
				<ul>
					<li>
						Users liked that they could indicate important preferences in the signup page, and saw that this
						would help
						inform Kopa’s roommate matching algorithm. This was in line with our expectations and even
						surprised us that
						they wouldn’t prefer more questions asking about their preferences and living habits.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b> Task 2: Find 2 rentals within a price range of $500-2,500/month.</b> (Browse Rentals Page)
				<ul>
					<li>
						Despite our disclaimer that buttons are not fully built-out, users complained that they couldn’t
						fully use
						the ‘Price’ dropdown and ‘Sort’ buttons. This resulted in one of the users stating that they
						couldn’t
						complete the task assigned. Perhaps, we should have done a clearer job explaining what could be
						done or
						built out those specific functions in our prototype better.
					</li>
					<li>
						No one used the expandible bookmarked box. We think that this was likely because the save
						listing
						functionality wasn’t built out, as our intention was that saving a listing would automatically
						add it to
						their bookmarked items and expand the box.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Task 3: Find roommates that are quiet and like the outdoors.</b> (Find Roommates Page)
				<ul>
					<li>Feedback was overall positive; users thought it was easy to browse contact cards and complete
						their task
						of finding roommates with specific interests and habits. </li>
					<li>One user noted that the writing was a bit small. This is a valid accessibility issue we would
						address
						if/when building out the actual website.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h4>User Testing Summary & Potential Changes</h4>
			<p>
				Overall, the users thought our design was pretty intuitive to use and had a positive experience. They
				also
				liked its 2-in-1 function of browsing rentals and finding roommates. Some ​potential interface changes​​
				we
				would make based on your UserTesting results and feedback include:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Increasing text size in listings & roommate cards for better accessibility and readability
				</li>
				<li>
					Reconsidering the format and placement of ‘Bookmarked’ box for increased visibility, perhaps closer
					to the
					listings column.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Project Summary</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, we really enjoyed having to work together to iteratively design a website around a startup
				idea.
				Since we all had summer internships in cities outside of our college town, we definitely resonated with
				the pain
				point Kopa's concept of combining short-term rentals with finding roommates addresses and hope the
				founders
				might find our designs helpful.
